The purpose of this site is as a note about what I do. It is a tedious work to search again about something that 
you have done. So, I will be taking notes about my work in this site.

### A little about myself

My name is Hazim. Currently a degree student in Industrial Automation and Robotics at UniKL MFI.
I realize that one part of learning is taking notes.
But I hate taking notes. Really hope that this site will spark my interest in taking notes or doing documentation about what I learn and do.

### What I will be take note about

Well, mostly related about what I learn and currently been working on. Some project might include arduino, raspberry pi and various sensors and actuators. Something that I learn from current semester and so on might include machine vision, plc, and many more. Please take note that I am no expert on the things that I will be writing in this site, So, feel free to contact me if you notice any mistakes. Please don't ask me about my mini project in certain subject, if you cannot find it in my github, it means that I don't save it.
